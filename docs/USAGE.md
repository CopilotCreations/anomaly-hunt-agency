## How to Play

### The Objective

Your goal is to find subtle visual anomalies hidden on each level's screen. These aren't real dead pixels—they're simulated artifacts that test your observation skills.

### Basic Gameplay

1. **Observe the screen carefully**
   - Look for any pixel that seems slightly different
   - Pay attention to subtle movements or color variations

2. **Tap where you see an anomaly**
   - Tap directly on the suspected anomaly location
   - You have limited attempts per level

3. **Use device conditions to reveal anomalies**
   - Some anomalies only appear under certain conditions
   - Try changing brightness, rotating your device, or waiting

4. **Progress through levels**
   - Each level gets progressively harder
   - Higher levels have smaller, more subtle anomalies

### Types of Anomalies

| Type | Description | How to Spot It |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Pixel Offset | A single pixel slightly out of place | Look for misaligned pixels |
| Subtle Gradient | A barely visible color fade | Watch for slight color variations |
| Temporal Flicker | A pixel that appears and disappears | Be patient and watch for blinking |
| Pixel Cluster | A small group of misaligned pixels | Look for small irregular patterns |
| Color Shift | A hue that changes subtly | Watch for shifting colors |
| Rotation Reveal | Appears when rotating device | Tilt or rotate your device |
| Orientation Dependent | Visible only in portrait or landscape | Switch between orientations |

### Visibility Conditions

Some anomalies become more visible under specific conditions:

#### Brightness-Based
- **Low Brightness**: Dim your screen to make certain anomalies more visible
- **High Brightness**: Some anomalies appear only at high brightness

#### Motion-Based
- **During Rotation**: Slowly rotate your device to reveal hidden anomalies
- **Orientation**: Try switching between portrait and landscape modes

#### Time-Based
- **Animation Phase**: Some anomalies flicker at specific intervals—wait and watch

### Scoring System

Your score is based on:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Difficulty Level | Higher levels give more base points |
| Accuracy | Tapping closer to the center gives bonus points |
| Remaining Attempts | Using fewer attempts increases score |

### Attempts and Game Over

- Each level gives you a limited number of attempts
- Missing an anomaly costs one attempt
- Finding an anomaly does NOT cost an attempt
- Run out of attempts = Game Over
- You can retry the level or return to menu

## Settings

Access settings from the main menu to customize your experience.

### Accessibility Options

#### High Contrast Mode
- Makes anomalies more visible with yellow highlighting
- Recommended for players with visual impairments
- Background becomes pure black for maximum contrast

#### Reduced Motion
- Slows down all animations
- Makes time-based anomalies easier to spot
- Reduces visual fatigue

#### Haptic Feedback
- Vibrates on successful finds
- Different vibration pattern for misses
- Can be disabled if preferred

### Gameplay Options

#### Sound Effects
- Toggle game sounds on/off
- (Sound effects available in future updates)

#### Show Hints
- Displays tips about visibility conditions
- Shows what actions might reveal the current level's anomalies
- Recommended for beginners

## Tips and Tricks

### Beginner Tips

1. **Start with hints enabled** - Learn the mechanics first
2. **Try the obvious locations first** - Corners and edges are common spots
3. **Be patient** - Some anomalies take time to appear

### Advanced Strategies

1. **Systematic scanning** - Move your eyes methodically across the screen
2. **Use peripheral vision** - Sometimes anomalies are easier to spot indirectly
3. **Create conditions** - Actively manipulate brightness and orientation
4. **Learn the patterns** - Each anomaly type has characteristic behaviors

### Expert Mode

For the ultimate challenge:
1. Disable hints
2. Turn off high contrast mode
3. Keep brightness at default
4. Try to find anomalies without moving the device

## Accessibility

Dead Pixel Detective is designed to be accessible:

- **Visual**: High contrast mode, adjustable anomaly visibility
- **Motor**: Large touch targets, generous tap detection radius
- **Cognitive**: Hints mode, clear feedback, simple mechanics

If you need additional accessibility features, please contact us through the app store.

## Troubleshooting

### Anomaly Not Appearing
- Try changing screen brightness
- Rotate your device
- Wait for animation cycles
- Check if hints mode reveals the condition

### Touch Not Registering
- Ensure you're tapping within the game area
- Tap and hold briefly if quick taps aren't working
- Check if haptic feedback helps confirm taps

### App Running Slowly
- Close other apps
- Enable reduced motion mode
- Restart the app
